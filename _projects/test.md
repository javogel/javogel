So here we are. I finally have my own space on the web. I will post on an assortment of topics. Mainly about programming, the arts, travel, and my own thoughts. Even if the topics are dispersed I will try to use tags to taxonomize as best as I can. Most importantly, I'll try to be consistent, and stick to this. Even if it means posting very short things to begin with. Hopefully that way I can find a rythm.

I'm looking forward to sharing my journey with you.
