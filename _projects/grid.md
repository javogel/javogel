This is the first project I share on here. It is an exploration of a grid systems. A rectagle is split into rows and columns, creating squares. Each square becomes its own world. I can hold a shade or patter, it could hold nothing, or be subdivided further into more tiles. 

Some of the primites I've explored so far are concentric circles and triangles, horizontal lines, cross-sections, cubes, polygons, etc. Combining them leads to interesting results.
