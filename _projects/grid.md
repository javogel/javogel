This is an exploration of grid systems. The image is split into squares, those squares can nest into smaller quares or they can display one of the primitive shapes. Some of the ones I've explores so far are basic circles, triangles, horizontal lines, cross-sections, cubes, polygons, etc.

As more primitves are created, they can be mixed in. Sometimes I configure it to emit only one primitive type and it produces interesting results.
