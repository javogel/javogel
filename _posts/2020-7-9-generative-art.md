Give the computer an instruction. Tell it to draw a circle here. Make the circle move and change colors according to the music. How about according to your mood? Is that possible? How about adding some pseudo-randomness. What if we make the circle morph and shape-shift into all the things we enjoy. Elephants, a couch, books, paneer, a moment to spare.  Like an ensless parade. A dream. Meanwhile the music is still blaring. Oh, I think that would be swell.
