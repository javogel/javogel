Something that has tremendously helped me on my journey as a Software Engineer is learning through Koans. 

##What are Zen Koans?

Koans in Zen are a sort of spiritual puzzles. Most times in the form of a short question posed by a master to a student. They are usually acompanied by a story. The plot can go something like this: a master poses a Koan to his student. The student then ponders over the question at hand. He tries several times to produce the right answer, but fails repeatedly, revealing to the master that he does not understand yet. The master guides the student by pointing the direction, but it is the student on his own who must reach understanding. The student keeps coming back with responses until he finally reaches the right answer, understanding the question, and one step closer to enlightenment. 


##How is the concept of Koans applied to programming languages?

It first started off with the [Ruby Koans][ruby]. They take inspiration from the concept of Zen Koans, basically short questions that require some fundamental understanding to get correct. These questions are applied by way of unit tests. And in these specific Koans there is even a path to enligtenment and a master guiding you so you don't get lost. The [Ruby Koans][ruby] are a CLI(Command Line Interface) based tool. Very easy to get started, and highly addictive once you get going. 

This same concept has, lucky for us students of programming, propagated to other languages. You can pretty much find Koans for any programming language that you wish. They come in varying flavors of implementation, with slightly different nuances and dificulty levels. But the general feeling is the same. At least for the ones I have tried.

I have found the Koans to be wonderful tools for getting a significant, yet highlevel view of a new programming language. All in 2-4 hours. Say, if I'm thinking of learning a new language, or I need to have a better grasp of it, for a personal project, or for work, I will usually get started the Koans for that language. It eases the learning curve for me. 

Here are some of the ones I've done and can recommend:
- [Ruby][ruby]
- [Javascript][javascript]
- [Python][python]
- [Elixir][elixir]

Even if your language of choice is not on the list, try searching for them. Chances are they already exist in some form or other in someones github. Gotta be grateful for the wonderful world of Open Source, at least as it relates to software.
